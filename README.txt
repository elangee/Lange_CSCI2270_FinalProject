Final Project

I want to create a taxi app. The program will have a list of cities/places and a list of people needing rides and to where. 
These can be user inputs or not. The user will input a starting destination and the app will calculate the most efficient
route to take to pick people up and drop them off at their destination. One function will be to have the people share a taxi ride
if they are going to a location near the current destination. Basically this program will sort out the most distance efficient 
manner in which to pick up and drop people off. 

the program will run as follows
pick a starting location for the taxi
populate a list of people needing pickup and their destinations (some kind of random function)
plot the directions to the nearest person and their destination
check if there are any other people within a certain distance of the route you will take
check if 2nd persons destination is closer, if so drop them off first
otherwise proceed on current path
the cab will have a maximum number of passengers so that will have to be taken into account with the carpooling
proceed through list of people untill completed
