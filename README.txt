Final Project

I want to create a taxi app. The program will have a list of cities/places and a list of people needing rides and to where. 
These can be user inputs or not. The user will input a starting destination and the app will calculate the most efficient
route to take to pick people up and drop them off at their destination. One function will be to have the people share a taxi ride
if they are going to a location near the current destination. Basically this program will sort out the most distance efficient 
manner in which to pick up and drop people off.
